# Online Shopping API
I want to learn Java along with spring boot to practice the development of cloud and web enterprise applications. So, I created an application that would be good practice for improving my coding skills using these unfamiliar programming languages. 

This REST application offers services to e-commerce platforms. An application like this would be great for someone that doesn't have a backend system setup for processing data while looking to develop and integrate a frontend system for online user interaction.
