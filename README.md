# Online Shopping API
I want to learn Java along with spring boot to practice the development of cloud and web enterprise applications. So, I created an application that would be good practice for improving my coding skills using these unfamiliar programming languages. 

This REST application offers services to e-commerce platforms. This application could also benefit someone who wants to focus on designing a frontend system for people who enjoy shopping online.
