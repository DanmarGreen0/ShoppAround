# Online Shopping API (Still In construction)
The sole purpose of this project is to help advance my programming skills and knowledge as a Java developer developing cloud and web enterprise applications. 

To accomplish this goal, I have decided to create a fully functional E-commerce web application that requires me to learn how to implement numerous different web application functionalities. My focus on computer language and framework for this project are Java, Springboot, and ReactJS. I choose to name this web Application ShoppAround.

The ShoppAround web application will consist of a front-end and a back-end system like any other native E-commerce web application online, for example, E-commerce web platforms like Amazon, eBay, Walmart, etc. It will be a Consumer-to-Consumer E-commerce web application.

## Installation 
Found inside the prerequisites section below are the tools required to run the ShoppAround application on your computer. Feel free to skip any of these tools if you have them already installed on your computer.
## Prerequisites
1. Install a code editor or IDE. [`vscode (recommend)`](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and npm.
`npm install npm@latest -g`
3. Install Java [`Java 1.8 or later`](https://gradle.org/install/) 
4. Install Gradle [`Gradle 7.5+`](https://gradle.org/install/)
5. After installing all tools need for running the ShoppAround application, clone the github repository main branch.
6. Now open the cloned repository folder inside your IDE on your machine. 
7. Then open two terminal windows inside you IDE. In the next step you will be asked use both of terminal windows to run the back-end server and the front-end web application.
8. In one of these terminal window use the command-line and run the command `./gradlew bootRun`. On the command line in the next terminal window navigate to the sub-folder named `shopparound-app`. Here is the file path `\src\main\webapp\WEB-INF\view\shopparound-app`. In that same derectory, using the command-line to run the command `npm start`.
9. The application should open in your web browser automatically. If a browser window didn't open, manually open a browser window and enter the url [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) and hit enter. If everything goes smoothly the application should be up and runny and ready to be used.
